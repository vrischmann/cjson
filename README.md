cjson
=====

This is just a simple JSON parser in C++ (more like C-with-classes really).

I don't think you'll ever want to use this in this state, it's:

  * really not well-tested
  * not a lot of features you might want

Mainly, it's for my personal use in some Win32 apps, as I don't want to include/depend on a library.
